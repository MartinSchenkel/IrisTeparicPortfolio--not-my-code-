                <p>
                    I am a 3rd year animation student and motion capture supervisor at BUas. In my spare time, I enjoy chicken soup, video games, illustration and learning about storytelling.

                <p>Last Resort is a student project I worked on as an animator in my third year of university. The game released on Steam in June 2021 as a free co-op first person shooter with rougelite elements. It was a year long project intended for a team of 25-30; for half of the year I was the only animator in the team and after that I was joined by Cameron Woad, 
				a fellow student. <br> <br> My main focus was first person animations, but I also worked on some of the enemies such as the melee large enemy we call "the carrier" for the egg it carries on its back. To check out our steam page, click on the image on the left! </p>

                <p>Temple of Giants is a student project I worked on as an animator in my secondy year of university. The game released in July 2020 on itch.io as a free third person puzzle platformer. The team consisted out of 16 people; 
				two of which were animators.<br><br>This was a really fun project that gave me the opportunity to work alongside a VFX artist to animate the player character's earth bending abilities</p>
